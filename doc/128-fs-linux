# 3 >> you have multiple options when it comes to configuring
# your kernel. you can either copy an existing config, use
# `make localmodconfig` to create a config that only has the
# symbols enabled that your system needs, or just manually
# configuring it using `make nconfig` or `make menuconfig`.
#
# once you figure out a way to configure your system, to build
# the kernel based on your configuration, do:
make $(($(nproc)+1))

# 4 >> install modules with:
make modules_install

# 5 >> copy the kernel image, config and system map with:
cp -iv arch/x86/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz
cp -iv System.map /boot/System.map
cp -iv .config /boot/config

# i >> read this bit to configure your bootloader, grub, which
# we built earlier for a bios system:
