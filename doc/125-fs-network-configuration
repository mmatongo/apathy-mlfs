# fs:		network configuration

# i >> unlike the traditional sysvinit bootscripts, we don't create
# individual files to configure the network. instead, modify the
# bootscripts to change the adapter and the local network settings.

# 1 >> open up the network bootscript with vim:
vim /etc/init.d/network

# 2 >> change these lines to fit your machine:
IFACE=enp2s0		# whatever adapter name that eudev gave you
IP=192.168.1.32		# your local ip
GATEWAY=192.168.1.1
PREFIX=24
BROADCAST=192.168.1.99

# i >> the apater name can be found by:
ip addr

# 3 >> resolv.conf
cat > /etc/resolv.conf << "EOF"
# apathy-mlfs resolv.conf
nameserver 1.1.1.1
nameserver 1.0.0.1
EOF

# 4 >> hostname
echo "apathy-mlfs" > /etc/hostname

# 5.1 >> remove the old hosts file created when
# building perl:
rm -rfv /etc/hosts

# 5.2 >> create the new hosts file
cat > /etc/hosts << "EOF"
127.0.0.1	localhost
127.0.1.1	apathy-mlfs	apathy-mlfs
EOF
